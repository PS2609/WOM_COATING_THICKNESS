This python file presents a neural networks training method using pre-preprocessing of data by principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize the number of network inputs and the genetic algorithm to determine the optimum initial weights in network training by back propagation.The main aim for this project is to determine the thickness of the desired coating for digitalising the thermal spraying process. 

This project has been created as part of the competition TATA Women of Mettle .
